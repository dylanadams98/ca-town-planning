# personal-portfolio-project

This project is an ongoing personal portfolio of applications produced on the course.

My goal with this project was to create a content-stream style portfolio, focused on imagery and dynamic design.

I have included multiple reactive elements and an initial blur transition, with a semantically structured HTML and CSS.

Ideally I would have liked to remove the project headers and included this in the hover function with text appearing over a blur in. I couldn't get this to work so I left the headers and tried to keep the flex formatting as tight as possible.

The portfolio works well on both web and mobile but there are some issues with the formatting that would improve this situation.

This was a useful project to further explore some of the more advanced CSS tools and how they interact with eachother.
